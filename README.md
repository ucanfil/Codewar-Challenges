# Description About This Repository

> In this repository i'm trying to gather my kata solutions. In each folder's README file you will see a short description of kata and examples that shows how it should return.

> In app.js files *Solution - 1* is my solution, and the rest is usually the best practices people have choosed and sometimes my selections combined.
